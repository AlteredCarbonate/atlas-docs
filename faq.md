# FAQ

## Why should I use this framework?

If you want to create your own gamemode and needs a starting point, this framework is perfect for you. I contains our experience as Software Developers and our definition of modularity. If you search for a plug & play system, you are completly wrong with this. But if you want to teach your self to next level development with [alt:V](https://altv.mp/#/) or TypeScript, it is perfect for you.

## How much does the framework cost? 

Good news! Nothing. The complete framework is free and open source. We respect the work of [alt:V](https://altv.mp/#/) and would like to give a little piece back.

## Is this a complete runable gamemode like RP?

No, this is only a framework to help you writting your own gamemode. We create an example Gamemode to show you the benefits for using this framework and we write our own Gamemode within.

## Is this like ESX for fiveM?

No, we don't have any kind of external plugin system at this point. Our goal is not, to create a system for plug & play. We want to improve the Code Quality for each gamemode written in TypeScript.

## I am missing some features, can you implement it?

For sure, we can implement base features for core systems. But we don't implement specific gamemode features like an Inventory or a Job System for RP Servers. This must be done by yourself.   
If you have an idea or feature request, come join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb) and share it.

## I don't understand anything do you provide custom support?

First things first, before you start using this framework, you need knowledge about TypeScript. Without this knowledge you are not able to understand the main benefits of this system.  
  
If you teach yourself with TypeScript and anything is confusing, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb) and ask your questions.

## Is there a place where i can find some scripts/snippets/recepies?

Yes it is planned, but at first release of this Framework this section would not be completed or fullfilled. From time to time we publish snippets/scripts/recepies for using inside the Framework. If there is some cool idea, we want to integrated directly to core systems. Keep your eyes on sidebar **Recepies**, **Snippets**, **Scripts** or our ****[Discord](https://discord.gg/DcpsfkVkfb).
