## Example Usage

This example does not demonstrate a realworld example. It will only teach you the usage with the decorator and the interaction with the bot.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To keep it simple as possible, there is a decorator for you to interact with bot events.  
Any available bot event from [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) are also useable with the decorator. The event params would be moved to the method.

Keep in mind, the decorator is only server side

{% tab title="Listen for GuildMemberUpdate" %}
```typescript
export class MyComponent {

    // If you want to do something if a guild member was updated
    // then you can easy listen for this event with a decorator

    @OnDiscord('guildMemberUpdate')
    public doSomething(oldMember: GuildMember, newMember: GuildMember): void {
        // You can now do something with the oldMember and the newMember
        // e.g. Check if a roles exists and kick if not
    }

}
```
{% endtab %}
