# Both Sides

## Module Decorator

The module decorator provides a simple way to load your components and other modules

{% hint style="info" %}
It is a good practice to split out your gamemode in modules and components to keep your file structured, clean and readable
{% endhint %}

```typescript
@Module({
    imports: [SecondModule, ThirdModule],
    components: [FirstComponent, SecondComponent, ThirdComponent]
})
export class YourModule {}
```

## Basic Event Decorator

{% hint style="info" %}
Every basic event decorator can have an parameter for the eventname to be listen  
If not provided, the name from decorated method would be use as eventname.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="@On" %}
```typescript
@On()
public playerDisconnect(player: Player): void {
  // playerDisconnect is the eventname for listen
}

@On('yourAwesomeEvent')
public doSomeMagicStuff(): void {
  // yourAwesomeEventis the eventname for listen
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="@Once" %}
```typescript
@Once()
public yourAwesomeEvent(player: Player): void {
  // yourAwesomeEvent is the eventname for listen
}

@Once('yourAwesomeEvent')
public doSomeMagicStuff(): void {
  // yourAwesomeEventis the eventname for listen
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Command Decorator

Creating sever console commands was not time easier before. You don't need to create or listen for specific event. Only this decorator is needed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Avoid using multiple commands with same name. Only the first registered command would be use.
{% endhint %}

### Basic Usage

{% hint style="warning" %}
The first param is optional, if not provided, the method name would be used as command name.
{% endhint %}

```typescript
@Cmd('hello')
public world(): void {
    // called if you write /hello inside your server console
}

@Cmd()
public world(): void {
    // called if you write /hello inside your server console
}
```

### Example

This example shows you the simple usage of this awesome decorator. The way they work is the same on both sides. The Example shows up a simple vehicle create command on server side.

```typescript
@Cmd('veh')
public createVehicle(name: string): void {
    const player: Player = alt.Player.local;
    const pos = new alt.Vector3({...player.pos}).add(2,2,0);
    const rot = new alt.Vector3({...player.rot}).toDegrees();
    const vehicleHash= alt.hash('name');

    const vehicle = new alt.Vehicle(
        vehicleHash, 
        pos.x, 
        pos.y, 
        pos.z, 
        rot.x, 
        rot.y, 
        rot.z
    );

    vehicle.numberPlateText = 'MyCar'
}
```
